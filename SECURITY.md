# Security Configuration for LRPDM Project

## Security Scanning Tools

### 1. Dependency Scanning
- **npm audit**: Built-in dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Snyk**: Advanced vulnerability scanning with remediation
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### 2. Code Analysis
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static analysis for common security issues
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in code

### 3. Security Policies

#### Dependency Management
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Critical vulnerabilities must be patched within 7 days
- High vulnerabilities must be patched within 30 days
- All dependencies must be from trusted sources

#### Code Security
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- SQL queries must use parameterized statements
- Authentication tokens must be properly secured

#### Infrastructure Security
- Database connections must use encrypted connections
- API endpoints must implement rate limiting
- CORS must be properly configured
- Security headers must be implemented

### 4. Security Testing
- Automated security scans on every PR
- Regular penetration testing
- Dependency audit on weekly schedule
- Security review for all high-risk changes

### 5. Incident Response
- Security incidents must be reported immediately
- All security patches must be tested before deployment
- Security logs must be monitored and retained
- Regular security assessments must be conducted
