# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## Spatial Database Rules
- ALWAYS create GIST indexes for geometry columns
- ALWAYS validate geometries with ST_IsValid() before storage
- ALWAYS use ST_Transform() for coordinate system conversions
- ALWAYS implement proper SRID constraints

## Code Generation Patterns
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React Query for API state management
- Follow atomic design principles for components

## File Processing Requirements
- Support CSV, Excel, Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML formats
- Use streaming for large files
- Implement progress indicators
- Validate data types and spatial references

## AI Integration Patterns
- Use Claude API for data suggestions
- Implement smart field type detection
- Provide data quality recommendations
- Auto-suggest geometry repairs

## Mobile Considerations
- All components must work on mobile
- Use React Native Web for code sharing
- Implement offline-first architecture
- Optimize for touch interactions
