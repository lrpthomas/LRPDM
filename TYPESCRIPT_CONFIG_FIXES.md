# TypeScript Configuration Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `composite: true` to all package tsconfig files
- `packages/api/tsconfig.json` - Updated with composite configuration
- `packages/api-legacy/tsconfig.json` - Updated with composite configuration
- `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` - Created new file with composite configuration
- `packages/web/tsconfig.json` - Created new file with composite configuration
- `packages/mobile/tsconfig.json` - Created new file with composite configuration

### 2. Created missing directory structures
- Created `packages/shared/src/` with basic index files
- Created `packages/mobile/src/` with basic React Native app structure
- Added `src/index.ts` at root level for the monorepo

### 3. Added proper include/exclude patterns
- Each package now has specific include patterns for their source files
- Excluded node_modules, dist, and test files
- Root tsconfig now uses `files` instead of broad includes to avoid conflicts

### 4. Set up project references
- All packages reference the shared package where needed
- Root tsconfig references all packages

### 5. Added necessary dependencies
- `@types/geojson` for shared package
- `@types/react-native` for mobile package
- `@types/node` and `@types/react-window` for web package
- Various missing dependencies for web package (react-native-web, lucide-react, etc.)

### 6. Created .gitignore files for each package
- Ensures dist directories and build artifacts are ignored

## Current Status

✅ **Working packages:**
- `packages/shared` - Builds successfully
- `packages/api` - Builds successfully
- `packages/mobile` - Builds successfully

⚠️ **Packages with code issues (config is correct, but code needs fixes):**
- `packages/api-legacy` - Has many TypeScript errors in the code
- `packages/web` - Has import and type errors that need resolution

## Next Steps

The TypeScript project references are now properly configured. To fully resolve all issues:

1. Fix code-level TypeScript errors in `api-legacy` package
2. Fix import paths and type errors in `web` package
3. Consider migrating from mixed Express/Fastify in api-legacy to pure Fastify
4. Update import paths in web components to use proper module resolution
